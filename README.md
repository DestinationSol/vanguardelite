This module adds the Vanguard Elite (internal name imperialBigElite), an upgraded version of the Vanguard.

It can be obtained by either starting a new game and selecting the ship, or buying it in a space station 
within a system other than the spawn system for 5000 credits. This module also adds this ship as an ally 
with three squads of three ships roaming around in each non-spawn system, as well as a station guard in
said systems.

As of 12/24/2024, the latest source build is required as the module utilizes changes made in a specific
file.
